  <h1 class="postTitle">Trotting Around the Corner of the Nation</h1>
  <p class="meta">August 27, 2016</p>
  
  <p>The San Francisco Bay Area is a beautiful, beautiful place. Unfortunately, on most days, I don’t see much of it. Save for a few glimpses of the Bay, my ride to work is completely riddled with development: a steady stream of apartments, strip malls, and expressways.</p>

<p>Fortunately, beauty is not something I expect from a commute. Besides, a daily dose of drab makes visits to places like Olympic National Park all the more spectacular.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/img/seattle/map.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Olympic National Park sits on the Olympic Peninsula, tucked away in the northwest corner of the contiguous 48. It is home to three distinct ecosystems: the coast, the mountains, and the temperate rain forest. Drawn by the variety, Christine and I flew to Seattle, rented a car and spent a weekend exploring all three.</p>

<p>Pulling out of the rental car parking after landing Friday night, it wasn’t long before we spotted the white peak of Mt. Rainier. It was impressive — large and unavoidable — more dominant than the Seattle skyline we would come back to in a few days. I found it symbolic of how much the forces of nature have shaped the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>In the morning we met Tom, another guest staying at our Airbnb. He was also headed for the park, but had been once before, back when hitchhiking was more prevalent. The driver who picked him up happened to be very familiar with the backcountry, and offered to guide the way. Tom said they bushwhacked their way to an unforgettable memory.</p>

<p>His story made me jealous and excited at the same time.</p>

<h4>The Mountain Range</h4>

<p>After breakfast we entered the park, headed for Hurricane Ridge. A winding, 17-mile road brought us to Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center, where we found a superb backdrop: a series of snow-capped peaks, far enough in the distance to inspire, but close enough to appreciate.</p>

<p>We began by hiking along <b>Klahhane Ridge</b>. It was a beautiful day. As we hiked, the fog seeped between the the sloping mountains.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/seattle/hurricane.jpeg" alt="" height="420px" width="100%">
Next, we hiked to the top of <b>Hurricane Hill</b> for another perspective of the surroundings. With the mountains ahead of us, we could turn 180 degrees and see straight into Canada across the Strait of Juan De Fuca. I loved the juxtaposition of expansiveness — one made of monuments, silent and grand, the other a soothing carpet of blue.</p>

<h4>The Coast</h4>

<p>In the afternoon, we drove to La Push. Having ventured to the western-most zip code in the contiguous USA, we were rewarded with…</p>

<p>A speeding ticket. La Push is so small that the cop not only recited the speed limit of our street, but of every other street in the town as well.</p>

<p>Aside from knowledgeable police, La Push is also notable for stunning beaches. We walked along <b>First Beach</b>, where we saw our first sea stacks— the icons of the Washington coast. Adorned with trees, shrouded by fog and filtered by sunlight, they are beautiful to gaze at.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/seattle/sea_stacks.jpg" alt="" height="420px" width="100%">
We visited a second beach, <b>Ruby Beach</b>, later the next day. In Washington, the forests continue until the edge of the sand.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/seattle/forest.jpeg" alt="" height="420px" width="100%">
It felt like I was backpacking the Lost Coast in Mendocino County again, except everything was multiplied. More driftwood, bigger rocks, and denser, greener trees.</p>

<h4>The Rainforest</h4>

<p>We spent Saturday night in Forks in a large luxury tent. In the morning, I asked the host, a man wearing a sleeveless leather jacket and sporting an overflowing beard, for recommendations about the <b>Hoh Rainforest</b>. I didn’t know it until I started writing this, but he was none other than Mick Dodge, star of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o7UzYDQtmM">National Geographic reality show</a> about his life in the forest.</p>

<p>We first walked along the short <b>Hall of Mosses</b> loop. The temperate rainforest is a vibrant place, flush with green from the plant life that teems at every inch. Moss cover the tree trunks and droop from the branches, photosythentic personifications of either wizards or Mick Dodge’s beard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/seattle/hoh.jpeg" alt="" height="420px" width="100%">
Along the <b>Hoh River Valley Trail</b>, we left the families and the noisy children behind and found ourselves in relative solitude. We walked through the forest and along the river until we reached a waterfall about 2.5 miles in. It was a perfect way to spend an afternoon; I was rejuvenated by the smells and the shade and the aesthetic of the ferns, by the aqua water of the Hoh River and the wide open valley behind it.</p>

<p>It was perfect until I stepped on a rock and rolled my ankle — but hey, I guess that’s the price of a little adventure in the corner of the nation.</p>
