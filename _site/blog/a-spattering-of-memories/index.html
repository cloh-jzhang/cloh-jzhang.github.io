  <h1 class="postTitle">A Spattering of Memories</h1>
  <p class="meta">September 05, 2015</p>
  
  <p>I remember you once wrote a quick list about me, to get the writing juices flowing again. Well, here I am writing about you, because I haven’t written in a while either, and I want to relive some of our memories.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our friendship before we started dating. I felt there always existed a certain understanding between us. One time there were a few of us in a car, probably me, Jacquie, and Rich, and you asked me what we were up to. I forgot what I said but we picked you up at Avalon. I forgot where we went but I remember you wore the most genuine “YAY” face as you got into the car. Knowing us, we probably all snorted yay in the bathroom. </p>

<p>Sometime after Bootie, I went on a second Coffee Meets Bagel date with a girl named Pia. We were supposed to do yoga in the morning but I woke up hungover, and I think she did too, so we got coffee instead. Near the end of the date I told her I was seeing another girl. She asked me who the lucky girl was; I said her name was Christine. </p>

<p>Soon after we started dating, we went six weeks without a weekend together. You were in Taiwan and at Coachella and I was in Montreal and Chicago. Between us, we posted so many Instagrams even Jacquie noticed how long it had been. On our first Friday together, we proceeded to do mushrooms. I needed to pee and Whitney was taking a shower, so I ran downstairs without my shoes. I started to trip hard, and I dragged you out into the rain with me. </p>

<p>Those six weekends apart were rough, but luckily, we hung out during the week because we lived so close. One particular Tuesday was a glorious sequence of events: your roommates left so we immediately started having sex. You came and we got dressed and headed straight to the best pizza place in North Beach I could find on Yelp. With happy bodies and a full stomach, we walked up to Coit Tower, overlooking the gorgeous Bay at night, back when the Bay Bridge was still lit with life. </p>

<p>The road trip to Oregon was the highlight of my year. We rafted down the Rogue River, it almost took your keys. I will never forget seeing Crater Lake, the most singularly beautiful sight I&#39;ve seen, for the first time. We paid our homage by eating a whole bag of Chex Mix in front of it, not saying much, keeping our eyes on that pristine blue. On the way back, the snow-capped Mt. Shasta peak blended in perfect harmony with the clouds. </p>

<p>We went to EDC and folk danced to Avicii. The next weekend we were in Monterey Bay, eating Chex Mix again along each mile of the 19-mile drive. </p>

<p>More recently, we biked to Outside Lands and brought the “folk” dance back for Mumford and Sons. We sat on a baseball field in San Carlos and counted shooting stars. I watched as you packed for New York City. You were listing the items you needed: socks, contacts, jackets, all that good stuff. You came up to me, tried to fold me up and tried to take me with you. It was so cute. </p>

<p>Here’s to the next batch of memories, grand and mundane, triumphant and silly, that we will create together. </p>
