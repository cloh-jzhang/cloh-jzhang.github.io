  <h1 class="postTitle">Everything in Belize Tastes Like Chicken</h1>
  <p class="meta">December 06, 2015</p>
  
  <p>Names are a cinch in Belize, just like the currency (1 US dollar = 2 Belize) or the language (English). The Old River that runs through Belize City is brackish, but the New River, to the northwest in Orange Walk, is freshwater. Hattieville is the settlement created in 1961 in the aftermath of Hurricane Hattie. The world’s largest cemetery bisected by highway is found on Cemetery Road. This easy-going attitude permeated the five days that Christine and I spent there in December 2015.</p>

<p>We landed in Belize City in the early afternoon. The climate was inviting: warm, but not suffocating. Immediately, we saw the country’s mangrove ecosystem: dense green groves of tropical trees about fifteen feet high everywhere, especially along the river. Belize City itself is cobbled together. Run down homes and buildings are everywhere, half built, abandoned, wood rotting. The roads are dirt, or full of potholes. Thankfully, we expected this (having done our research), and took to the sea.</p>

<p><em>Day 1: Ambergris Caye</em></p>

<p>Our first stop was San Pedro, the largest city on Ambergris Caye, Belize’s largest island. The waters of the Caribbean are gentle - playful even, compared to the Pacific. A 1.5 hr ferry ride carried us past mangroves and through splashes of tropical rain. </p>

<p>San Pedro runs almost entirely north and south. It’s an approachable town - no more than a few streets wide - but busy. While walking to our hotel mid-afternoon, We passed a steady wave of golf carts and children in white uniforms walking home from school. </p>

<p>Tired from our red eye flight, we headed to the west side of the island to eat dinner (cocktails, a delicious lobster burrito and grilled carne asada with rice). A few streets away, kids played basketball next to the ocean under the setting sun. We walked back with the rhythms of the town, and just like that, we were part of another carefree day in the Caribbean. </p>

<p><em>Day 2: Hol Chan Marine Reserve/Caye Caulker</em></p>

<p>We woke early to watch the sunrise from the beach (the beauty of these islands - the sun rises and sets over beaches separated by blocks, not miles). Unfortunately, clouds blocked the sun and we didn’t see much. But all was well, because we were headed to Caye Caulker for a day of snorkeling, reggae music, and rum punch. </p>

<p>Caye Caulker is much smaller than Ambergris Caye. It’s also quieter, as the “Go Slow” motto beckons. The stands along the beach are run by smiling owners selling Belizan breakfast and fresh fruit smoothies, exuding the best type of island vibe.</p>

<p>It was my first time snorkeling in some time, and I had a little trouble getting my bearings. Luckily, I got them in time to experience the wonders of Hol Chan Marine Reserve. It’s amazing - viewed from the boat, the treasures of the ocean are expertly hidden, but an exotic and varied world exists only a few feet below. </p>

<p>Hol Chan Marine Reserve is part of the world’s second largest barrier reef. Colorful corals cover the sea floor. They are crowded by schools of feeding fish, swaying in unison to the currents like the ripples of a wave. Larger fish floated by, lacking both urgency and a sense of direction. </p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>At one point, the ocean floor dropped suddenly. The waters turned dramatic: darker, colder, more vast. Along the bottom of the floor, a manta ray drifted blithely forward. On our way back to the boat, we ran into a green eel moving about in its alien way. </p>

<p>We closed out the day drinking Belikins at the split, enjoying the sunset with vacationers from around the world, feeling festive and the perfect amount of tired, eagerly awaiting the next day. </p>

<p><em>Day 3: Lamanai</em></p>

<p>Belize, being an English speaking country that accepts US dollars, may have felt like an extension of home, but thousands of years ago, it was part of the Mayan Empire. On our second full day, we explored Lamanai (Mayan for submerged crocodile), a major civilization center thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>Our trip had two legs: by car and by boat along the New River. Ever since touring Tibet in 2010, I’ve loved sitting in cars in foreign lands, doing nothing but pondering the surrounding landscape. What I found striking about the Belize countryside is just how green it is. The color dominates the plant life - I was hard pressed to find even an orange or white flower. All the trees are all around the same height as well, and the homogeneity is defining. </p>

<p>Due to heavy rain the week before, the New River overflowed its banks by about 4 feet. Considering that many streams in California today can barely afford a trickle, the river felt particularly full and vibrant.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/belize/new_river.jpg" alt="" height="450px" width="600px">
</figure>

<p>We got a personal peek at wildlife on the river. Within minutes of boarding, a spider monkey with freakishly long limbs ventured close, seeking out the food he was accustomed to getting from tour boats like ours. When the river widened into a lagoon an hour later, we arrived. Immediately, we heard the frightening howl of howler monkeys, who wield their howl to protect their territory.</p>

<p>First inhabited around 16th Century B.C., Lamanai contains a series of temple ruins in the middle of the jungle. Today, many of the temples mounds have been reclaimed by nature, and lie covered by a rumble of dirt. The few unearthed temples are beautiful. Their sizes are imposing, their symmetry gives them aesthetic appeal, and their uniqueness conjuring images up the ancient world that they belonged to. We climbed atop the steps of the highest temple (aptly named High Temple) to enjoy the view. With the New River at our backs, surrounded by miles of the verdant jungle canopy, I pictured nighttime ritual sacrifices, illuminated by flames from the temples, emanating life like the gods they reverently honored.</p>

<p>When we headed back to Belize City in the mid-afternoon, we were more than ready to escape the unrelenting swarm of mosquitoes. </p>

<p><em>Day 4: Zip-lining, ATVs</em></p>

<p>It rained heavily all day, which foiled our original plan to go cave tubing. Instead, we went back to the jungle for zip-lining and ATV riding. </p>

<p>The heavy rain brought out our adventurous spirit. We were soaked, but zipping. At times, the rain came down so hard it was tough to open our eyes. But when we could, we saw the familiar vastness of the jungle, this time spread across the slopes of hills and above streams swollen with muddy waters. </p>

<p>As I have never ridden an ATV before, much less through the mud swamped jungle, it was an unforgettable experience. Our vehicles handled the terrain effortlessly, powering over rocks and protruding branches and makeshift ponds. It was fun coaxing the ATV by angling our bodies and surveying the path to pick the routes with the best mix of adventure and safety.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/img/belize/atv.jpg" alt="" height="450px" width="600px">
</figure>

<p>After the ride, we waded across a slippery stream that reached our waist. The ground was slippery and our guide was the first to fall in. Of course, I was next. </p>

<p>It was a fitting end to our stay in Belize, a country where nature dictates the splendors and the dangers, the experiences and the casualties (one of my favorite shirts, covered in mud, and our skin, covered in mosquito bites).</p>
