        <title>Pacific Northwest, Day 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Crater Lake is a gift, a display of nature’s genius when all the conditions are just right. The clear, transparent blue water dominates the senses, extending almost as far as the eyes can see. On a good day like today, the water perfectly mirrors the sky. The lake exudes tranquility - some silences are meant to ring forever - and even the wildlife know that they are lucky to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, at this time of the year, there’s not a whole lot to do in Crater Lake.
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/crater_lake_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Definitely worth more than a thousand of my words&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I want to record something more important about today. I’ve been with Christine since Thursday afternoon, by far the longest time I have ever spent with someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the indefensible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine doesn’t like cilantro. Her membership amongst the fun deprived, friendless citizens of the world &lt;b&gt;is confirmed&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the defensible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sees beauty in every moment, and knows how to capture it by keeping a photo trail of her life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She likes to go ‘Wheeeee’ when passing a sluggish driver, because the world is her playground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She will put up with a lot in the name of good adventure, including an easily distracted navigator and an inexperienced rafter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is a skilled reader, quick to discern what’s important and what’s not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knows what she doesn’t know, but doesn’t let it get in the way of what she wants to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot this trip to the Pacific Northwest, and saw many breathtaking sights. But when it&amp;#39;s all said and done, I&amp;#39;ll remember how Christine&amp;#39;s smile made me beam and that her laugh is a required nutrient for my soul. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pacific Northwest, Day 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was about learning. Christine and I talked about concepts we never really grasped, navigated the pulse of Southern Oregon, and found new ways to take on the world as a team of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, inspired by William Zinnsser&amp;#39;s advice capturing the idea of a place when travel writing, I started hoarding information about Crater Lake. For the next hour, Christine and I launched into hypothetical scenarios, emptying the water in America’s deepest lake on a whim and instantly refilling it with 250 years worth of evaporation, rainfall, and snowmelt. At brunch, an orange peel became a convex lens, but metamorphic powers weren’t enough to fully understand cameras. The egg biscuit sandwich, on the other hand, was easy to describe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The residents of Shady Cove are down to earth, honest folk of the truest sense - it’s impossible not to be when living along the Rogue River. Nothing else can compel a new father to wade knee deep in the water, daughter strapped on his back. Fisherman, drawn by the promise of salmon, go out in droves - families, grills, pickup trucks, 50 stars and 13 stripes in tow. When we ask about the next fish, it’s the river that responds with realism, humor and warmth. For software engineers from San Francisco, the river is a wave that crashes straight onto Christine in a failed attempt to raft into a current head on. After gradually learning how to coax our raft along, the river connected us to the homeowners along its banks. We floated by to their smiles and waves, happy to share the ebb and flow of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/rogue_river.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Our view for 3 hours&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine and I feasted on a large pizza and cold beer that night. Next time, we&amp;#39;ll take that Hawaiian Pizza and refreshing blonde ale back to the river. We&amp;#39;ll invite all the fisherman to join us (mainly to play with their dogs), and we’ll take a big ol&amp;#39; breath of that good ol&amp;#39; American air.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pacific Northwest, Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We woke up and dutifully typed something about working from home. Before those words reached our colleges, we were on the the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molded by volcanic eruptions, Lassen Volcanic National Park is home to fascinating natural phenomena, the first of which was set against an immense backdrop of pine trees, boulders, and streams. Stepped out of the car, we found ourselves in the middle of an ancient volcano. A few miles below, raging magna activated steam, fumaroles and boiling mudpots, not to mention the stench of rotten eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on, stopping at a lake that appeared amongst the branches. I took a moment to be immerse myself in the sounds of nature. When I opened my eyes, I saw Christine making her way across a tree trunk that had fallen into the water, eyes straight ahead, her steady determination the only soul in sight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/summit_lake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; 
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Next time we&#39;ll go for a swim&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The touch of fate blessed us for the rest of the day. After a hike around a lily pond, it started to rain. We plunged into the safety of a lava tube, a third of a mile long and pitch black. In my heart I like to believe that the flow of lava naturally creates a tunnel to one day help astonished travelers stay dry. Later, driving next to Mt. Shasta, we took a wrong turn. I heard a gasp - a few feet in front of us, three black bears were crossing the road. We watched as a cub swiftly climbed a tree, disappearing into the forest, leaving us in excited awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We entered Oregon under a vibrant pink and orange sky, the vastness of the land etched vividly into our minds. Here’s to scattering the imagery of today into our dreams, and recalling the memories of today often throughout our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alcatraz</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some periods in life are covered by clouds, periods when what you don’t have makes it hard to appreciate all that you are blessed with. It’s during these times that simple interactions standout the most. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My senior year of college was such a time. My mind was weighed down by clouds I could not escape. I was at the end of four years in Berkeley, equally weary of partying and studying. Most of all, I was lonely and a virgin, watching from the sidelines as my friends lived  carefree lives with their girlfriends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uD73765nt4&quot;&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Waiting for the clouds to part, waiting to be out of the dark &lt;/br&gt;
If our future’s bright, then the present is overcast &lt;/br&gt;
And we want it to be over fast, lets shine&amp;quot;&lt;/br&gt;
Waiting for the Clouds - Nujabes &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine joined the fraternity I was in during our sophomore year. We became part of the same friend group, but didn’t get to know each other until two years later. After a night in Las Vegas, we unexpectedly found ourselves bonding over growing up Asian in the suburbs, eventually getting escorted off restricted ground by Caesar Palace security guards. I remember how her presence made me feel at ease, momentarily parting a few clouds from my sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved three blocks from one another after graduating college. Embracing life in San Francisco, we spent the weekends clubbing and bar hopping, and inventing excuses to eat carne asada fries. The comfort I felt with her grew. I noticed how incredibly kind she was, saw how much she loved and cared for her friends. I looked forward to her company because it was so easy being around her. Plus, she was always ready for an adventure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs&quot;&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“You can’t start a fire, you can’t start a fire without a spark&lt;/br&gt;
This gun’s for hire, even if we’re just dancing in the dark&amp;quot; &lt;/br&gt;
Dancing in the Dark - Bruce Springsteen &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine and I started dating in early March 2015. Walks through the city after foosball and Chinese food replaced Bootie and Origin.  Above &amp;amp; Beyond at the Bill Graham Theater was one of my best nights of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bll6rQIQaVc&quot;&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“No I never had a night like this, &lt;/br&gt;
 No I never had a night like this  &lt;/br&gt;
I ain’t never shine bright like this  &lt;/br&gt;
It’s more than beautiful, more than beautiful&amp;quot; &lt;/br&gt;
Top of the World - OCD: Moosh &amp;amp; Twist  &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost a year since we moved to San Francisco. Lights from the Bay Bridge no longer enliven a long commute back to limited privacy. With the novelty of living in the city fading, we needed a change in perspective. Last Sunday, Christine and I took the ferry to Alcatraz Island. As night fell, we followed in the footsteps of America’s most notorious prisoners to the top of a hill. Below us, birds crooned at one another, oblivious to the world around them. As I put my arm around Christine, the magnificent San Francisco skyline formed in front us. I couldn’t have imagined a better view: there wasn&amp;#39;t a single cloud in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQs9hco8HVw&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Take me to a place &lt;/br&gt;
Where we both don’t have to face &lt;/br&gt;
The things we faked &lt;/br&gt;
There’ll be nothing on my mind&amp;quot; &lt;/br&gt;
Nothing On My Mind - Astronomyy &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
