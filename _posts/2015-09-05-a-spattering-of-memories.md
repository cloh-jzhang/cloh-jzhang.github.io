I remember you once wrote a quick list about me, to get the writing juices flowing again. Well, here I am writing about you, because I haven’t written in a while either, and I want to relive some of our memories.

I enjoyed our friendship before we started dating. I felt there always existed a certain understanding between us. One time there were a few of us in a car, probably me, Jacquie, and Rich, and you asked me what we were up to. I forgot what I said but we picked you up at Avalon. I forgot where we went but I remember you wore the most genuine “YAY” face as you got into the car. Knowing us, we probably all snorted yay in the bathroom. 

Sometime after Bootie, I went on a second Coffee Meets Bagel date with a girl named Pia. We were supposed to do yoga in the morning but I woke up hungover, and I think she did too, so we got coffee instead. Near the end of the date I told her I was seeing another girl. She asked me who the lucky girl was; I said her name was Christine. 

Soon after we started dating, we went six weeks without a weekend together. You were in Taiwan and at Coachella and I was in Montreal and Chicago. Between us, we posted so many Instagrams even Jacquie noticed how long it had been. On our first Friday together, we proceeded to do mushrooms. I needed to pee and Whitney was taking a shower, so I ran downstairs without my shoes. I started to trip hard, and I dragged you out into the rain with me. 

Those six weekends apart were rough, but luckily, we hung out during the week because we lived so close. One particular Tuesday was a glorious sequence of events: your roommates left so we immediately started having sex. You came and we got dressed and headed straight to the best pizza place in North Beach I could find on Yelp. With happy bodies and a full stomach, we walked up to Coit Tower, overlooking the gorgeous Bay at night, back when the Bay Bridge was still lit with life. 

The road trip to Oregon was the highlight of my year. We rafted down the Rogue River, it almost took your keys. I will never forget seeing Crater Lake, the most singularly beautiful sight I've seen, for the first time. We paid our homage by eating a whole bag of Chex Mix in front of it, not saying much, keeping our eyes on that pristine blue. On the way back, the snow-capped Mt. Shasta peak blended in perfect harmony with the clouds. 

We went to EDC and folk danced to Avicii. The next weekend we were in Monterey Bay, eating Chex Mix again along each mile of the 19-mile drive. 

More recently, we biked to Outside Lands and brought the “folk” dance back for Mumford and Sons. We sat on a baseball field in San Carlos and counted shooting stars. I watched as you packed for New York City. You were listing the items you needed: socks, contacts, jackets, all that good stuff. You came up to me, tried to fold me up and tried to take me with you. It was so cute. 

Here’s to the next batch of memories, grand and mundane, triumphant and silly, that we will create together.
