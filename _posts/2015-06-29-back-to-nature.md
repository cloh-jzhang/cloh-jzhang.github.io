After being bombarded last weekend by fantastic light, color, sound (and booty) during a scorching EDC Las Vegas, we enjoyed the peaceful but rugged California Coast like one savors a light, seductive touch on the forearm.

Starting early Saturday morning, we explored a world renowned marine habitat on kayak. First, we saw sea lions, masters of the art of slumber, who had full claim to the aisle of rocks protruding from the pier. Being right on the water, we were level with birds majestically grazing the ocean surface. Christine found a refuge from my shenanigans as we observed resting sea otters; I don’t blame her for favoring the mother otter, who spends up to eight months floating with her child against her belly, a selfless shield from the perils below, over me. Turning into a harbor inlet, our guide directed us to crabs teeming like a horrifying mass of spiders and scooped up a horrendous sea slug that dyed Christine’s hand with thick purple ink. After parking our kayaks on the beach, we peeled off our wetsuits and revealed impressive sunburns. 

Next, we drove south to Point Lobos State Park after a few hours at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Point Lobos is a place where the ocean enlivens even the inanimate rocks, a place where a jagged mixture of layer and pattern morph into the edge of the land. Arm in arm, Christine and I ambled with the waves, content to let the anthems of last week fade into darkness. At night, we stumbled upon Del Monte Beach and our own electric sky - a saturation of orange and pink and yellow, the most brilliant sunset I have ever seen. 

At noon on Sunday, we hit the surf with the best of our (limited) abilities. For the next two hours, I was liberated, fully engaged, entranced by the smooth, glass-like water that I was trying my hardest to ride. I’ll fondly recall those two hours for the rest of my life. I’ll feel myself pushing myself to my feet with my arms, and prepare for the tumble. With understanding, I’ll greet my underdeveloped sense of balance. I’ll watch Christine rising to her feet, one cautious knee at a time - my girlfriend, consistently rising to the challenge. I’ll see my two feet and realize that I’m upright on my only successful ride to the shore, the curve of the wave making me giddy and weightless. I won’t remember how I did that exactly, only that I found something I need to experience again, and again, and again. 

As we headed home that afternoon, we drove along the 17-mile drive, getting familiar with The Spanish Bay and The Lone Cypress. Starting this weekend and throughout the drive back to San Francisco, I wore a new ribbon with zeal, the only prize I need for being a participant of the world.
