After a scorching EDC Las Vegas and the bombardment of light, sound, color and skin, we enjoyed this weekend getaway like one savors a light, seductive touch to the forearm.

We started early Saturday, exploring Monterey Bay on kayak, paddling level with birds majestically grazing the ocean surface. First, we saw sea lions, masters of slumber, who had fully claimed the rocks protruding from the shore. We then stopped to observe sea otters. Upon seeing them floating, Christine ignored me completely; I don’t blame her for favoring the mother otter, who spends up to eight months with her child held against her belly, a selfless shield from perils lurking below, over me. Turning into a inlet, our guide directed us to crabs teeming like a horrifying mass of spiders and scooped up a plump sea slug that briefly dyed Christine’s hand purple. After parking our kayaks on the beach, we peeled off our wetsuits, revealing impressive sunburns. 

Next, after a few hours at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, we drove to Point Lobos State Park, where the ocean enlivens the rocks into a jagged mixture of layer and pattern. Arm in arm, Christine and I ambled along the rugged California Coast, letting last week's anthems fade into darkness. At night, we gazed at an organic electric sky on Del Monte Beach - a saturation of orange and pink and yellow, the most brilliant sunset I have seen.

At noon on Sunday, we hit the surf with our (limited) abilities. For the next two hours, I was liberated, fully engaged, entranced by the waves, the smooth, glass-like water. For the rest of my life, I’ll feel myself pushing up with my arms. I'll prepare for the ensuing tumble. I’ll intimate my underdeveloped sense of balance. I’ll watch Christine rise to her feet, one cautious knee first - my girlfriend, consistently rising to the challenge. I’ll see my two feet and realize that I’m upright on my only successful ride to the shore, weightless and giddy from the curve of the wave. I won’t be able to describe how it happened, only that I need to experience it again, and again, and again. 

Midway through the drive back home, I feel asleep. When I woke up and reflected on our new experiences, I found a ribbon - the only prize I need for being a participant of the world.
