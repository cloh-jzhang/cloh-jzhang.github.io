I’m reading Cool Gray City of Love, 49 vignettes about places in San Francisco. Each chapter is a separate story - only Kamira’s dedication to his city ties them together - histories of people and the land they walked on woven together with personal experiences. The writing is reverent, a poetic tribute, and I heard its echoes throughout our trip to Angel Island on Sunday. 

The bike ride from Christine’s apartment to the Angel Island Ferry is as smooth as any in the city - a straight shot down Valencia, right on Market until the shimmering bay, capped by a cruise down Embarcadero.
