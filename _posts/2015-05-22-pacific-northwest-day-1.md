We woke up and dutifully typed something about working from home. Before those words reached our colleges, we were on the the road.

Molded by volcanic eruptions, Lassen Volcanic National Park is home to fascinating natural phenomena, the first of which was set against an immense backdrop of pine trees, boulders, and streams. Stepping out of the car, we found ourselves in the middle of an ancient volcano. A few miles below, raging magna activated steam, fumaroles and boiling mudpots, not to mention the stench of rotten eggs.

We continued on, stopping at a lake that appeared amongst the branches. I took a moment to immerse myself in the sounds of nature. When I opened my eyes, I saw Christine making her way across a tree trunk that had fallen into the water, eyes straight ahead, her steady determination the only soul in sight.

The touch of fate blessed us for the rest of the day. After a hike around a lily pond, it started to rain. We plunged into the safety of a lava tube, a third of a mile long and pitch black. In my heart I like to believe that the flow of lava naturally creates a tunnel to one day help astonished travelers stay dry. Later, driving next to Mt. Shasta, we took a wrong turn. I heard a gasp - a few feet in front of us, three black bears were crossing the road. We watched as a cub swiftly climbed a tree, disappearing into the forest, leaving us in excited awe.

We entered Oregon under a vibrant pink and orange sky, the vastness of the land etched vividly into our minds. Hereâ€™s to scattering the imagery of today into our dreams, and recalling the memories of today often throughout our lifetime.
