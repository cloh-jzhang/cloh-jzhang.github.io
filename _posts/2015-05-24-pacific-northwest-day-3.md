Crater Lake is a gift, a display of nature’s genius when the conditions are just right. The clear, blue water dominates the senses, extending almost as far as the eyes can see. On a good day like today, the clouds float in the water. The lake exudes tranquility - some silences are ring forever - and even the wildlife know they are lucky to be there.

With that being said, at this time of the year, there’s not a whole lot to do in Crater Lake.

So I want to record something more important about today. I’ve been with Christine since Thursday afternoon, by far the longest time I have ever spent with someone. 

First, the indefensible. 

Christine doesn’t like cilantro. Her membership amongst the fun deprived, friendless citizens of the world is confirmed.

To the defensible. 

She appreciates every moment, capturing its beauty through a photo trail of her life.

She likes to go ‘Wheeeee’ when passing a sluggish driver, because the world is her playground. 

She will put up with a lot in the name of good adventure, including an easily distracted navigator and an inexperienced rafter. 

She is a skilled reader, quick to discern what’s important and what’s not. 

She knows what she doesn’t know, but doesn’t let it get in the way of what she wants to know. 

I learned a lot this trip to the Pacific Northwest, and saw unforgettable sights. But when it's all said and done, I'll remember how Christine's smile made me beam and that her laugh is a required nutrient for my soul.
