Today was about learning. Christine and I talked about concepts we never really grasped, navigated the pulse of Southern Oregon, and found new ways to take on the world as a team of two.

I woke up early, walked around Ashland, and started hoarding information about Crater Lake. For the next hour, armed with curiosity, Christine and I launched into hypothetical scenarios, emptying America’s deepest lake on a whim and instantly refilling it with 250 years worth of evaporation, rainfall, and snowmelt. At brunch, an orange peel became a convex lens, but metamorphic powers weren’t enough to fully understand cameras. The egg biscuit sandwich, on the other hand, was easy to describe. 

The residents of Shady Cove, Oregon, our next stop are down to earth and honest - it’s tough not to be when living along the Rogue River. It compels a new father to wade knee deep in the water, daughter strapped on his back. Fisherman, drawn by the promise of salmon, go out in droves - families, grills, 50 stars and 13 stripes in tow in their F150s. When we ask about the next fish, it’s the river that responds with realism, humor and warmth. For software engineers from San Francisco, the river is a wave that breaks onto Christine during a failed attempt to tame a current. Eventually, we learned when to carve our oars deep into the water and when to gently graze the surface, and we were free to connect with the homeowners along the river bank. We floated by to their smiles and waves, happy to share together the unrelenting ebb and flow.

Christine and I chased our large pizza down with cold beer that night. Next time, we'll take that Hawaiian Pizza and refreshing blonde ale back to the river. We'll invite all the fisherman to join us (mainly to play with their dogs), and we’ll take a big ol' breath of that good ol' American air.
