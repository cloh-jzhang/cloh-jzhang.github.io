Today was about learning. Christine and I talked about concepts we never really grasped, navigated the pulse of Southern Oregon, and found new ways to take on the world as a team of two.

When I woke up, inspired by William Zinnsser's advice capturing the idea of a place when travel writing, I started hoarding information about Crater Lake. For the next hour, Christine and I launched into hypothetical scenarios, emptying the water in America’s deepest lake on a whim and instantly refilling it with 250 years worth of evaporation, rainfall, and snowmelt. At brunch, an orange peel became a convex lens, but metamorphic powers weren’t enough to fully understand cameras. The egg biscuit sandwich, on the other hand, was easy to describe. 

The residents of Shady Cove are down to earth, honest folk of the truest sense - it’s impossible not to be when living along the Rogue River. Nothing else can compel a new father to wade knee deep in the water, daughter strapped on his back. Fisherman, drawn by the promise of salmon, go out in droves - families, grills, pickup trucks, 50 stars and 13 stripes in tow. When we ask about the next fish, it’s the river that responds with realism, humor and warmth. For software engineers from San Francisco, the river is a wave that crashes straight onto Christine in a failed attempt to raft into a current head on. After gradually learning how to coax our raft along, the river connected us to the homeowners along its banks. We floated by to their smiles and waves, happy to share the ebb and flow of the world.

Christine and I feasted on a large pizza and cold beer that night. Next time, we'll take that Hawaiian Pizza and refreshing blonde ale back to the river. We'll invite all the fisherman to join us (mainly to play with their dogs), and we’ll take a big ol' breath of that good ol' American air.
