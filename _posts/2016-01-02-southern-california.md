My wall has a new addition, a map of U.S. National Parks that I received as a Christmas gift from Christine. Using tacks, we’ve turned the map into a playful game. My color is red, Christine’s color is yellow. Green is for parks that we both have visited. 

This new year’s break, we camped at Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks, adding two green tacks to our totals. Due to an insistence on counting two parks that she visited when she was equal parts young and forgetful, the tally stands at 12-10, Christine.


### Death Valley

Some aspects of Death Valley are easy to describe. It’s the largest national park in the lower 48 states. It's home to the lowest point in North America, perched 282 feet below sea level. Furnace Creek, our camp site, once scorched 134 degrees - the highest recorded temperature in history. These facts and figures are only a basic primer on the desolate landscape that overwhelms you with size and stark beauty. 

After a 9 hour drive that started at 5:30 a.m., we hopped out of the car for a stroll and a view at Father Crowley Vista. In an unsecured wooden bench at the end of the path, we found a comfortable place to enjoy our surroundings.

Death Valley is so vast that landmarks are often 30 minute drives apart. During these drives, we would pass sand dunes and look for the moon rising behind the mountains. We drove past the desert palette mixing with the sun during the day, and watched for coyotes crossing the road before our headlights at night.

After one of the aforementioned drives, we went for a short hike that knifes through Golden Canyon. The canyon walls along the trail are jagged and colorful, decorated by layered patterns. Rivets hint at flowing water millions of years ago. The walls are also immense.

Golden Canyon was our first sense of scale: trapped within the wall's barren hold, it's easy to forget that the canyon is but a tiny fraction of the park's wonders, a small branch on a Giant Sequoia. Back at the trailhead, the valley expands for miles left and right, and the mountains loom steady in the distance. 

With the sun setting, we hurried to Badwater Basin, famous for  its geography and its salt. The lowest point in the North America, the basin is the final resting point for flash floods carrying rainwater. The water quickly evaporates, leaving behind salt that accumulates into a wide field of white crystal. After the sunset bled through a slit between two mountains, we walked back with a lingering taste of salt in our mouths.

Death Valley transforms at night. 

### Joshua Tree

After descending, we headed south, back towards civilization, where we were fittingly greeted by an hour-long line to check in to our hotel.
