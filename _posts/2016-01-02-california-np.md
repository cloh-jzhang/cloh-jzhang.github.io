My wall has a new addition, a map of U.S. National Parks. Using tacks, Christine and I have turned the map into a playful game. My color is red, Christine’s is yellow. Green is for parks that we both have visited. 

We recently camped at Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks, adding two green tacks to my wall. Due to her insistence on counting two parks that she visited when she was young and forgetful, the tally stands at 12-10, Christine.


### Death Valley

Numbers can describe some aspects of Death Valley, a desolate landscape that overwhelms you with its size and stark beauty. Spanning more than 3 million acres, it’s the largest park in the lower 48. It's home to the lowest point in North America, perched 282 feet below sea level. It once scorched 134 degrees - the highest recorded temperature in history. 

Death Valley is so vast that landmarks are often 30 minute drives apart - after a 9 hour drive, these minutes were taxing. But along the way, we passed sand dunes and a unique desert palette, looked for the moon behind the mountains and scanned for coyotes before our headlights.

Our first stop was a short hike that knifes through Golden Canyon. The canyon walls along the trail are jagged and colorful, decorated by layered patterns. Rivets hint at phantom streams of flowing water. More than anything, the walls are immense.

Golden Canyon was our first sense of scale: trapped within its barren hold, it's easy to forget that the canyon is but a tiny fraction of the park's wonders - a small branch on a Giant Sequoia. Back at the trailhead, the valley expanded again for miles left and right, and the mountains loomed steady ahead. 

With the sun setting, we hurried to Badwater Basin, famous for  its geography and its salt. The lowest point in North America, the basin is the final resting point for flash floods. The rainwater quickly evaporates, leaving behind salt that accumulates into a wide field of white crystal. Exploring until the sunset leaked through   a distant valley, we walked back with a lingering taste of salt in our mouths.

Death Valley transforms at night. Engulfed by darkness, the contours of mountain and canyon disappear. Without competing light from nearby cities, stars filled every corner of the sky and it  sparkled like we've never seen it sparkle before. 

We had intended on hiking the Mesquite Sand Dunes under the moonlight, but as we learned, sometimes the moon waits until after 10 p.m. to even creep above the horizon. So in our tents and under the magnificent night scape - my favorite scene from our road trip - we fell fast asleep. 

In the morning, we returned to the sand dunes, which we turned into a playground. We jumped over smooth ridges and slid down slopes only to run back up - and bade farewell to Death Valley.

### Joshua Tree
jkkk
From Death Valley, we drove south to Joshua Tree National Park, home to curious trees, impressive boulders, and one memorable campground. 

Arriving with an hour of daylight left, we were relieved that we didn't have to venture far to enjoy the park. Even along the park's main road, Joshua Trees were everywhere. They hugged the edge of the ashpalt and sprouted every few feet - if they were taller, we'd be driving through a forest - and their short, thick branches growing out like curved fingers reminded me of neurons, albeit in plant form.

The trees share the park with massive rock formations, some of which are named after the shapes they resemble. We stopped at Skull Rock, which was a bit tourist infested. On our hands and feet, we scrambled up a bit futher, where we found a childhood friend, Bulbasaur Boulder.

To end our day, we headed to Keys View, where we watched sun fall over the Salton Sea, the snow capped Mt. Jacinto Peak, and the San Andreas Fault. Afterwards, it was time for camping.
